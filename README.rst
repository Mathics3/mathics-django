mathicsserver: a Django-based Web interface

Installing
----------

This package needs a working `Mathics3`, the core engine, installed as well as a recent
version of Django. For Django, you will need mysql or mariadb
installed, since that is where worksheets are stored.

See the `Installing Mathics <https://mathics-development-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_ for instructions on installing Mathics3.

If you are a novice at installing Python packages, consider using either a pre-built OS package if available under "Packaging status" above,
or the `mathics docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/mathicsorg/mathics>`_.


Ubuntu/Debian Specific OS dependent packages
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On Ubuntu or Debian::

  apt install default-libmysqlclient-dev.

Install from PyPI
+++++++++++++++++

Once Mathics3 is installed, run::

   pip install Mathics-Django


Install from Github source
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From the place root directory that github was checked out::

  make install


Running
-------

This is a Django project, so Dango's `manage.py <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/django-admin/>`_ script used.

A simple way to start Mathics Django when GNU make is installed (which is the case on most POSIX systems):

::

   make runserver

Underneath this runs the Python program ``manage.py`` in ``mathics_django`` directory.

To get a list of the available commands, type ``python
mathics_django/manage.py help``. To get help on a specific command
give that command at the end. For example two commands that are useful
are the ``runserver`` and ``testserver`` commands. ``python
mathics_django/manage.py help runserver`` will show options in running
the Django server.

Once the server is started you will see a URL listed that lookss like this::

   Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Point your browser to the URL listed above. Here it is ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``

Environment Variables
+++++++++++++++++++++

There are two special environment variables of note which controls
where the Mathics database is located. This database is saves
authentication and worksheet information.

By default the database used is ``DATADIR + mathics.sqlite`` where
``DATADIR`` is under ``AppData/Python/Mathics/`` for MS-Windows and
``~/.local/var/mathics/`` for all others. If you want to specify your own database file set
environment variable ``MATHICS_DJANGO_DB_PATH``.

If you just want to set the ``mathics.sqlite`` portion, you can use
the environment variable ``MATHICS_DJANGO_DB``.

Information for the online-documentation comes from one of two places,
``DOC_USER_HTML_DATA_PATH`` if that exists and
``DOC_SYSTEM_HTML_DATA_PATH`` as fallback if that doesn't exist. The
latter is created when the package is built. The former allows for the
user or developer to update this information. In the future it will
take into account plugins that have been added.
